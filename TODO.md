### Current

### Next Up

-   Create some clear documentation about how the cursor is tracked and how we deal with it.

### Backlog

-   Get rid of global `global_history_manager` variable.

    -   On that node, I should add some sort of `Engine` class that contains all the other stuff.

-   I should add a ton of helper methods to `tree.Position` like `Position.previous_sibling`.
    That should make interactions with the model tree significantly easier.

-   Create a lossless video to show of the project.
