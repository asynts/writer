### Current

### Next Up

-   Implement undo and redo logic.

    -   When we switch to another model tree, we have to be extremely careful with invalidating layout nodes.

### Backlog

-   I should add a ton of helper methods to `tree.Position` like `Position.previous_sibling`.
    That should make interactions with the model tree significantly easier.

-   At some point, I need to go through the codebase

    -   Add comments to each module in the codebase.

    -   What is good or bad about the codebase?

-   Create a lossless video to show of the project.
