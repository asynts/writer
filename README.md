This is a prototype of a writer application that I want to add to Serenity OS.

-   It should be similar to Libre Office Writer or Microsoft Word, but much simpler.

-   My goal here is to write my own layout engine, which is essentially a simplified version of CSS
    but without a text representation to define the rules.
