### Notes

-   After adding some text, I noticed that some elements were overlapping.

### Theories

-   I suspect, that this is a sign error somewhere.

-   I suspect, that I forgot to emulate the behaviour of a `BlockLayoutNode` correctly.

-   I suspect, that I am not considering the border correctly in some calculation.

-   I suspect, that I am rounding some floating point number to an integer somewhere.
