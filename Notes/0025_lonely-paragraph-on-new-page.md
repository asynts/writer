When a paragraph overflows we place the first overflowing line on the next page and then split the paragraph.

### Notes

### Tasks

-   Verify that this is truely the issue.
    I am a bit confused with the lorem ipsum text that I have been using.
    Maybe use that helper function that I use with the study in scarlet example.

### Theories

-   I suspect, that we decide to split the paragraph without testing if the line fits on the new page.
